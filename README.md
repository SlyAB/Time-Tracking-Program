<h1>Time Tracker</h1>

<h2>What is it?</h2>
<p>Time tracker is a simple  python program that keeps track of user work hours and amount earned within that period. Features off the program are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Records start and end times a user worked during the day</li>
<li>Calculates hours worked and amount earned during that day</li>
<li>Automatically saves data to a csv file</li>
<li>Allows user to view saved data and statistics related to it</li>
</ul>
<p>The conversion used for the program is, an hour worked generates $5 <i>i.e 1hour = $5 earned.</i></p>
<p>The file generated by the program is stored under the name <i>timetracker.csv</i> in your current directory or folder.</p>
<p><strong>NB:</strong> The program does an awesome job at identifying every single situation that could lead to an error and takes the necessary precautions that is why the code appears plenty than necessary.</p>

<h2>Modules</h2>
<p>The program uses python's standard built-in libraries for it's implementation. Modules imported are:</p>
<ul>
<li>date - To keep track of the current date data is being recorded</li>
<li>csv -  To save recorded data to a csv file for later use</li>
<li>os - To check file availability</li>
</ul>

<h2>Design</h2>
<p>The program uses 3 self defined functions for it's functioning.</p>
<ul>
<li>diff_mins() - Used by <i>start_tracking()</i> for running part of it's code</li>
<li>start_tracking() - Contains code that starts the main tracking process and saves data to a csv file</li>
<li>view_data() - Contains code for retrieving saved data from the <i>timetracker.csv</i> file</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to use</h2>
<p>To start using the program run the <i>TimeTracker.py</i> file</p>
<p>To start the tracking process select 1 from the menu and follow prompt</p>

<p>To view your saved data select 2. Sample data is shown below.</p>

<p>To do nothing and close the program the last option is your only option. LOL.</p>
<p>Don't be scared of making a mistake when entering data beacause Time Tracker gives you the chance to try again as many times as it takes you to get everything right.</p>
<h3>ENJOY!</h3>
